        "  Physician: Good morning, Ms. Jones. How are you feeling today?\n",
        "  Patient: Good morning, doctor. I’m doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.\n",
        "  Physician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?\n",
        "  Patient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.\n",
        "  Physician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?\n",
        "  Patient: Yes, I always do.\n",
        "  Physician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?\n",
        "  Patient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.\n",
        "  Physician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?\n",
        "  Patient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn’t do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.\n",
        "  Physician: How did things progress after that?\n",
        "  Patient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really bad—I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.\n",
        "  Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?\n",
        "  Patient: It’s not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It’s nothing like before, though.\n",
        "  Physician: That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?\n",
        "  Patient: No, nothing like that. I don’t feel nervous driving, and I haven’t had any emotional issues from the accident.\n",
        "  Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?\n",
        "  Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn’t really stopped me from doing anything.\n",
        "  Physician: That’s encouraging. Let’s go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.\n",
        "  [Physical Examination Conducted]\n",
        "  Physician: Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and there’s no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.\n",
        "  Patient: That’s a relief!\n",
        "  Physician: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I’d expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.\n",
        "  Patient: That’s great to hear. So, I don’t need to worry about this affecting me in the future?\n",
        "  Physician: That’s right. I don’t foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you’re on track for a full recovery.\n",
        "  Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.\n",
        "  Physician: You’re very welcome, Ms. Jones. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.\n",
